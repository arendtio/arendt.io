# Using the Pareto Principle to Correct Estimates

A few days ago, I saw someone wrote on the internet: 

> [...] multiply that by 2 (because developers are always wrong by a factor 2) [...]

In that moment I thought:

> Hey man, that's so wrong... First of all, it really depends on the

> of the developers, ... (so much more).
> And if you really want to come up with a general correction factor,

I didn't write any of that. 4 was just a number I had made up
from my personal experience over the past years. Today I found out,
why it might be closer to the truth than I thought.

## The Pareto Principle

Whenever someone asks us if we are done, we will probably answer

> Almost, we got 80%, we just got to do [...]

The [Pareto Principle][1] states that

> [...] 80 percent of consequences stem from 20 percent of causes.

In the case of time consumption to the results we produce,
it means that we produce 80% of the result in just 20% of the time.

So we arrive at 80% very quickly but for the remaining 20% of the
result, we need 80% of the time.

## Calculating and Correcting Estimates

When we are doing something we have never done before (which is good),
we have little experience and therefore we can't know whats ahead.

So we might guess: After 4 hours I will be almost complete, the rest
should be done in another hour. So the total estimate would be **5
hours**.

If we use the Pareto Principle to correct that estimate, we would
start thinking: after 20% of the time we will be at 80% (almost
done), but we will need 80% of the time to complete the task.
So if 4 hours result in a time consumption of 20%, the corrected result
of the estimate is **20 hours**.

If you compare the initial estimate of 5 hours to the corrected
result of 20 hours, you will find a **correction factor of 4** ;-)

## Conclusion

While this method is certainly not fit to be used for anything but
tasks or small projects it is a simple and to some extent reasonable
method of correcting estimates to become more realistic.
